# hunter-rs

Rust CLI tool to perform a domain search from the Hunter.io API.

> Get every email address found on the internet using a given
> domain name, with sources.

## Usage

Basic usage is as follows.

```bash
  KEY=foo cargo run --release -- input.csv output.csv
```

### KEY

Use your Hunter.io API key, provided here:
    https://hunter.io/api-keys

### input.csv

This is a list of domain names to search in the Hunter API. The CSV
must have two columns, named exactly as followed:

```
name,domain
```

### output.csv

This file is generated by the script and will contain all the data
downloaded from the Hunter.io API.

### --limit

You can also optionally specify limit. By default the script will request 100 emails, however if you're using a free Hunter.io account you'll need to set the limit to 10:  `--limit 10`.
